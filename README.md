## General outline of the project

1. Set up a Cloudflare tunnel and configure it remotely.
    This can be done locally with a config.yaml file but we are doing it through Cloudflare itself. Every time the CloudflareD container starts it will pull down the relevant configuration.

2. Set up the proper DNS records for our tunnel.
    Both the tunnel's **ingress rules** and the **DNS records** will be defined recusively, based on the predefined varaibles.

3. Set up Cloudflared container.
    Upon starting, its given a token that was defined in Step 1. It connects to Cloudflare and pulls the config.

The whole setup should take no more than a minute.

## üí° Commands used in this project
```bash
# Initializing/upgrading the project
terraform init -upgrade

# Imports the docker nextwork "cloudflared_network" for cloudlared & other containers if it exists.
# On first run, this shouldn't be a problem.
# Here is a one-liner, you need to supply the network name.
docker network inspect cloudflared_network -f "{{json .Id }}" | terraform import docker_network.cloudflared_network _

terraform apply -auto-approve

# Should destroy everything but the Docker network because it's probably used by other containers.
terraform apply -destroy -auto-approve
```
